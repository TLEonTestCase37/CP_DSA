Policy Based Data Structure 

Ordered set is a policy based data structure in g++ that keeps the unique elements in sorted order.
It performs all the operations as performed by the set data structure in STL in log(n) complexity and performs two additional operations also in log(n) complexity .

Use the following:-

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>
using namespace __gnu_pbds;

#define ordered_set tree<int, null_type, less<int>, rb_tree_tag, tree_order_statistics_node_update>
